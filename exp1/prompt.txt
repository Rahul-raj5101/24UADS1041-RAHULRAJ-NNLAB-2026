WAP to visualize the Perceptron Learning Algorithm using numpy and matplotlib/seaborn in Python. 
Evaluate performance of a single perceptron for NAND and XOR truth tables as input dataset.
Train the model until convergence and display weight updates after each iteration.
Visualize the learning process by plotting data points, decision boundary, and training error.
Plot training error curves and analyze convergence behavior.
explain the fundametntal of this experiment. 
Analyze and compare the behavior of the perceptron for linearly separable and non-linearly separable datasets.
