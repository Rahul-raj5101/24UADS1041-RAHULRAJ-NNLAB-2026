Write a simple Python program using NumPy to implement a perceptron for the AND gate.
Initialize all weights to zero and use a step activation function.

Include bias as an extra input with constant value 1 and update the weight vector size accordingly.
Train the perceptron using the learning rule until it converges (no errors in one full pass).
Print weights clearly after each update.

Use Matplotlib to plot the decision boundary on a proper 4-quadrant graph with x and y axes drawn and fixed limits.
Update the boundary dynamically during training.

Show training points with different colors or markers based on correct and incorrect predictions during learning.
After convergence, print the final weights and plot error versus epoch.
